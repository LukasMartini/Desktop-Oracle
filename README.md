# Desktop-Oracle
An application that allows for desktop access to the official Magic: the Gathering online Gatherer with support for keeping information available offline.

Fun Fact: this app is called a "Desktop Oracle" because I forgot that the scraped website was the Gatherer and not, in fact, the Oracle.
